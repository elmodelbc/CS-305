Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.  Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a public web interface. They are seeking Global Rain’s expertise in how to protect their client data and financial information.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I was able to address all their needs and concerns as the course progressed. It is important to write secure code as it will benefit the customer, their customers, and establish the credibility of the organization. Software security builds trust and confidence with users and customers that their interests are taken care of.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I felt that the ability to integrate your project in with a process to check against a vulnerability database enhances the ability of the developer to address issues on the fly.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

The ability to use the vulnerability database as well as applying industry best practices with code development added layers of security to the project. In the future, I see no reason to deviate from the tools that were provided in this course to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use. Naturally, as technology changes, so should the processes we use to identify and address vulnerabilities.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I used industry best practices and reliable tools to ensure the software application remained functional and secure. I also tested the application as code was modified to ensure that I did not introduce any incorrect code. After refactoring, I continued to test the code and check the database for vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used the resources in this course, the tools provided by Eclipse, and Java best practices while coding.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show them the completed Projects, One and Two, that demonstrate my ability to provide a strong solution to their business objectives.
